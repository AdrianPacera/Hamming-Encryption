It is a rough road that leads to the heights of greatness. It is quality rather than quantity that matters. 
The bravest sight in the world is to see a great man struggling against adversity. 
Wherever there is a human being, there is an opportunity for a kindness.

True happiness is to enjoy the present, without anxious dependence upon the future,
not to amuse ourselves with either hopes or fears but to rest satisfied with what we have,
which is sufficient, for he that is so wants nothing. 
The greatest blessings of mankind are within us and within our reach. 
A wise man is content with his lot, whatever it may be, without wishing for what he has not.

It is not that we have so little time but that we lose so much.
The life we receive is not short but we make it so; we are not ill provided but use what we have wastefully.
